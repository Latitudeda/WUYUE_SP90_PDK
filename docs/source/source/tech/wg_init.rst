__init__.py
===================

Define the WG class which consists of ``WGF.O.WIRE`` / ``WGM.O.WIRE`` / ``WGS.O.WIRE`` / ``SNF.O.WIRE`` class. The width of the waveguide is set here according the parameters in ``constant.py`` file.

**PhotoCAD** also support CD bias control of the waveguide width. The CD bias setting can be implemented in ``wgf.py`` / ``wgm.py`` / ``wgs.py`` / ``snf.py``.
